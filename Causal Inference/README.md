### Randomized controlled trials (RCTs):
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard approach for estimating the effects of treatments, interventions, and exposures (hereafter referred to as treatments) on outcomes.

### Potential outcome <a name="potential"></a>
For example, a person would have a particular income at age 40 if she had attended college, whereas she would have a different income at age 40 if she had not attended college. To measure the causal effect of going to college for this person, we need to compare the outcome for the same individual in both alternative futures. Since it is impossible to see both potential outcomes at once, one of the potential outcomes is always missing. This dilemma is the "fundamental problem of causal inference". 

### Average causal effect
An estimate of the ***Average Causal Effect*** (also referred to as the ***Average Treatment Effect***) can then be obtained by computing the difference in means between the treated (college-attending) and control (not-college-attending) samples.
