	title = {Learning {Explainable} {Models} {Using} {Attribution} {Priors}},
	abstract = {Two important topics in deep learning both involve incorporating humans into the modeling process: Model priors transfer information from humans to a model by constraining the model's parameters; Model attributions transfer information from a model to humans by explaining the model's behavior. We propose connecting these topics with attribution priors (https://github.com/suinleelab/attributionpriors), which allow humans to use the common language of attributions to enforce prior expectations about a model's behavior during training. We develop a differentiable axiomatic feature attribution method called expected gradients and show how to directly regularize these attributions during training. We demonstrate the broad applicability of attribution priors (\${\textbackslash}Omega\$) by presenting three distinct examples that regularize models to behave more intuitively in three different domains: 1) on image data, \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{pixel\}\}\$ encourages models to have piecewise smooth attribution maps; 2) on gene expression data, \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{graph\}\}\$ encourages models to treat functionally related genes similarly; 3) on a health care dataset, \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{sparse\}\}\$ encourages models to rely on fewer features. In all three domains, attribution priors produce models with more intuitive behavior and better generalization performance by encoding constraints that would otherwise be very difficult to encode using standard model priors.},

	abstract = {Interpretability has become an important topic of research as more machine learning (ML) models are deployed and widely used to make important decisions. Most of the current explanation methods provide explanations through feature importance scores, which identify features that are important for each individual input. However, how to systematically summarize and interpret such per sample feature importance scores itself is challenging. In this work, we propose principles and desiderata for {\textbackslash}emph\{concept\} based explanation, which goes beyond per-sample features to identify higher-level human-understandable concepts that apply across the entire dataset. We develop a new algorithm, ACE, to automatically extract visual concepts. Our systematic experiments demonstrate that {\textbackslash}alg discovers concepts that are human-meaningful, coherent and important for the neural network's predictions.},

We show that class prototypes, obtained using either an encoder or through class specific k-d trees, significantly speed up the the search for counterfactual instances and result in more interpretable explanations. We introduce two novel metrics to quantitatively evaluate local interpretability at the instance level. We use these metrics to illustrate the effectiveness of our method on an image and tabular dataset, respectively MNIST and Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic). The method also eliminates the computational bottleneck that arises because of numerical gradient evaluation for \${\textbackslash}textit\{black box\}\$ models.},

	abstract = {Machine learning models have had discernible achievements in a myriad of applications. However, most of these models are black-boxes, and it is obscure how the decisions are made by them. This makes the models unreliable and untrustworthy. To provide insights into the decision making processes of these models, a variety of traditional interpretable models have been proposed. Moreover, to generate more human-friendly explanations, recent work on interpretability tries to answer questions related to causality such as {\textbackslash}Why does this model makes such decisions?" or {\textbackslash}Was it a specific feature that caused the decision made by the model?". In this work, models that aim to answer causal questions are referred to as causal interpretable models. The existing surveys have covered concepts and methodologies of traditional interpretability. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey on causal interpretable models from the aspects of the problems and methods. In addition, this survey provides in-depth insights into the existing evaluation metrics for measuring interpretability, which can help practitioners understand for what scenarios each evaluation metric is suitable.},

	abstract = {Black box machine learning models are currently being used for high stakes decision-making throughout society, causing problems throughout healthcare, criminal justice, and in other domains. People have hoped that creating methods for explaining these black box models will alleviate some of these problems, but trying to {\textbackslash}textit\{explain\} black box models, rather than creating models that are {\textbackslash}textit\{interpretable\} in the first place, is likely to perpetuate bad practices and can potentially cause catastrophic harm to society. There is a way forward -- it is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This manuscript clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare, and computer vision.},

ABSTRACT = {Machine learning systems are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. These systems&rsquo;s adoption has been expanding, accelerating the shift towards a more algorithmic society, meaning that algorithmically informed decisions have greater potential for significant social impact. However, most of these accurate decision support systems remain complex black boxes, meaning their internal logic and inner workings are hidden to the user and even experts cannot fully understand the rationale behind their predictions. Moreover, new regulations and highly regulated domains have made the audit and verifiability of decisions mandatory, increasing the demand for the ability to question, understand, and trust machine learning systems, for which interpretability is indispensable. The research community has recognized this interpretability problem and focused on developing both interpretable models and explanation methods over the past few years. However, the emergence of these methods shows there is no consensus on how to assess the explanation quality. Which are the most suitable metrics to assess the quality of an explanation? The aim of this article is to provide a review of the current state of the research field on machine learning interpretability while focusing on the societal impact and on the developed methods and metrics. Furthermore, a complete literature review is presented in order to identify future directions of work on this field.},
